            <p>New York City is slowly getting back on its feet and some New Yorkers believe that the answer to a full recovery is simple: vaccinations. Thirty-year-old Justin McCallum, a wedding photographer who resides in Manhattan, had to travel recently.
“It’s amazing that so many locations are now requiring vaccinations for entry in various locations.”</p>

            <p>I moved to New York from the Philippines at age 14. For as long as I can remember, I’ve never felt like I was in danger being out and about. Not to say that I didn’t experience my fair share of racism then. But most of the time, they were just words and insults — and I’ve learned to just let them roll off my back and move on. Now, though, things are different. </p>
